pico-bme280
===========

This is an example program that reads BME280 sensor values with a Raspberry Pi
Pico using the official Bosch-API (SPI-interface).

Note that about 99% of the sellers offer a "BME280/BMP280"-breakout, but
instead of a BME280 (chip-id 0x60), you will most probably receive a cheaper
BMP280 (chip-id 0x56, 0x57 or 0x58). The former provides readouts for temperature,
pressure and humidity, while the latter lacks humidity.

You will find a similar project for the BMP280 in
<https://github.com/bablokb/pico-bmp280>.

This branch additionally writes the data to a ST7735-display connected via SPI.
The necessary library is a subproject.

After checkout of this project, run

    git submodule update --init --recursive

to pull in the required sources.
